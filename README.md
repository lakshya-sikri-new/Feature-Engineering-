This repository demonstrates advanced feature engineering techniques, with a focus on feature creation, data transformation, and working with datetime features. These techniques are essential for transforming raw data into usable formats for machine learning models, improving model accuracy, and ensuring the data is in the right form.

This notebook is part of a project where we explore how to effectively manipulate and enhance datasets using feature creation, transformation, and handling time-related variables.

# Overview
Feature engineering is the process of creating new features or transforming existing ones to improve the predictive power of machine learning models. This repository includes techniques for:

Feature Creation: Adding new features derived from existing ones.
Feature Transformation: Techniques such as normalization, standardization, and encoding to prepare features for modeling.
Datetime Features: Extracting and manipulating datetime components (like year, month, day, etc.) to better handle time-related data.

# Features Covered
This repository covers the following techniques:

Feature Creation:

Order Duration: Calculating the time difference between order date and ship date to create a new feature Order_Duration.
Profit Margin: Derived from profit and sales columns, showing the percentage of profit margin for each order.
Feature Transformation:

Log Transformation: Applied to skewed numerical features such as sales and profit to reduce skewness.
Normalization: Scaled numerical features like profit to a common range (0-1) using normalization.
Standardization: Scaled numerical data to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.
Datetime Features:

Extracting DateTime Components: Extracting the year, month, day, weekday, and other components from the order_date and ship_date columns.
Day of the Week: Identifying which day of the week each order was placed and shipped.
Month and Year: Extracting month and year for trend analysis over time.
Seasonal Features: Creating features based on the seasons (e.g., Winter, Spring) using the month feature.

# Steps in the Notebook
Data Preprocessing: Clean the dataset by handling missing values, checking for duplicates, and ensuring that the data types are appropriate.
Feature Creation: Derive new features like Order_Duration (difference between ship_date and order_date).
Feature Transformation: Perform necessary transformations on features such as sales and profit (log transformation, scaling).
Datetime Features: Extract components from datetime columns, such as day_of_week, month, year, etc., and use them as new features.
Encoding Categorical Features: Apply encoding techniques like one-hot encoding, label encoding, or target encoding to convert categorical features to numeric values.


# Results and Observations
Feature Creation: Generating new features like Order_Duration and Profit Margin helps provide insights into order processing and profitability.
Feature Transformation: Log transformation and scaling improved the data distribution, especially for skewed variables like sales and profit.
Datetime Features: Extracting and manipulating datetime components revealed potential trends over time, such as seasonality and weekday preferences.
